design-patterns
===============
This is the lab work I'm doing / have done for SWE200-01 (Design Patterns) in college.

I got tired of moving my files around on a thumb drive, and I don't want to pay $7.00 / Month for a private repo, so this'll be public.  If you're in my class, feel free to look at the code, but bear in mind that copying it directly would be cheating and you will wind up in very, very hot water.  Nobody wants that to happen.
